 COREUA311,"He's maybe one of the most caring professor I have encountered. He really tries to know everybody's needs and he wants to help everyone if he can.

No homework at all, but the labs are long and tedious.",5.0,3.0

 SF1,"He is a fairly easy grader on essays and tests, however in order to get the grades, you need to pay attention to his lectures.

 SF2,"Best professor. Despite on the surface being a ""tough"" teacher(he grades his essays harshly and gives pop quizzes if there is a need for it), his toughness in reality is just good teaching. He knows what he is doing and cares about the student in the long run. He will force you to improve and he will stimulate your brain cells.",5.0,4.0
 SFIII103,"Professor Bloch is genuinely one of the best professors I've ever had.

If you're considering taking his class, this is your sign to do so!",5.0,3.0
 SF3,"A great guy who genuinely respects all of his students and tries to be as transparent as possible. Assigns some easy and interesting readings.
